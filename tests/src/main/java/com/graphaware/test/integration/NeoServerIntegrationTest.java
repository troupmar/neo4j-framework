/**
 * Base class for server mode integration tests that are as close to real Neo4j server deployment as possible. As a consequence,
 * low-level access to {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService} is not provided. Instead, use {@link com.graphaware.test.util.TestUtils#executeCypher(String, String...)}
 * to populate/query the database.
 * <p/>
 * The target audience of this class are developers of GraphAware Framework (Runtime) Modules.
 * The primary purpose of tests that extend this class should be to verify that given a certain Neo4j configuration,
 * a (possibly runtime) module is bootstrapped and started correctly when the Neo4j server starts.
 * <p/>
 * The configuration file names are provided by overriding the {@link #neo4jConfigFile()} and {@link #neo4jServerConfigFile()}
 * methods. They default to "neo4j.properties" and "neo4j-server.properties" and if no such files are present
 * on the classpath of the implementing class, the ones that ships with Neo4j are used.
