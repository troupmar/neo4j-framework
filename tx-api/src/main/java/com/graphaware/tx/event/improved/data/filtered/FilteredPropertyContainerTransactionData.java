/**
 * Decorator of {@link com.graphaware.tx.event.improved.data.PropertyContainerTransactionData} that filters out {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer}s and properties
 * based on provided {@link com.graphaware.common.policy.PropertyContainerInclusionPolicy} and {@link com.graphaware.common.policy.PropertyInclusionPolicy}.
 * <p/>
 * Results of most methods returning {@link java.util.Collection}s and {@link java.util.Map}s will be filtered. <code>boolean</code>
 * and single object returning methods (and {@link #propertiesOfDeletedContainer(org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer)}
 * will always return the full truth no matter the policies. All returned {@link org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer}s will be wrapped
 * in {@link com.graphaware.tx.event.improved.propertycontainer.filtered.FilteredPropertyContainer}.
 * <p/>
 * So for example:
 * <p/>
 * {@link #getAllCreated()} can return 5 objects, but {@link #hasBeenCreated(org.neo4j.graphdb.PropertyContainer)} can
 * return true for more of them, as it ignores the filtering.
 * <p/>
 * When traversing the graph using an object returned by this API (such as {@link com.graphaware.tx.event.improved.propertycontainer.filtered.FilteredNode}),
 * nodes, properties, and relationships not included by the {@link com.graphaware.common.policy.InclusionPolicies} will be excluded. The only exception
 * to this are relationship start and end nodes - they are returned even if they would normally be filtered out. This is
 * a design decision in order to honor the requirement that relationships must have start and end node.
